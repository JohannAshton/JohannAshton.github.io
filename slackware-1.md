# The start of my one week with Slackware

As of today, I temporarily switching to Slackware on my laptop. It's the first time in ages that I've used a Linux distribution other than Arch Linux (unless you count Raspbian on my Pi 3 Model B), and I'm rather looking forward to it. I'm not sure if a week is really long enough to properly get to know a distro, so I may end up using it for a longer period.
This all started because of my failed efforts to get my father to give Arch a shot. He's a proponent of Slackware, and despises systemd (the init that Arch Linux and many other modern distributions use). However, when he found out that it's possible to use OpenRC in Arch, we decided we would swap distributions for a week.

I used to be a distro hopper, but I've thought for a while now that Slackware is worth trying. It has a secondary repo similar to Arch's AUR, SlackBuilds (<https://slackbuilds.org/>), which makes ricing a whole lot easier. I'm not sure if anything can compare to Arch in terms of ricing (visually at least), as many (perhaps even a majority) of the ricing community have settled there. Of course, that is something I can deal with, as Slackware provides many other benefits. It'll be my first experience using SysVinit, which is certainly worthwhile learning. I haven't joined the systemd hate train quite yet, even though I don't necessarily agree with what Lennart Poettering is doing to Linux these days. I do admit that Pulseaudio is a nightmare, and would have left it a while ago if it weren't for the rhythm game [osu!](osu.ppy.sh)'s requirement for low sound latency. 
This is rather a rambling post, as I don't have much of an idea of what to expect from Slackware. I'll talk more about what I think of it over the coming days.
